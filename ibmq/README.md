# Accessing IBMQ platform

Members of QAL can request access to the QAL Hub by asking one of the QAL admins to add you as a collaborator on one of the projects. To access the IBMQ platform via the QAL Hub:

* First, create an IBMid using your institution domain email address. It must be, for example, name@esciencecenter.nl. IBMid accounts using email domains such as gmail, Hotmail or other personal domains cannot be used to access the QAL Hub directly. 
* Sign up for IBM Quantum Experience (IQX) account using your newly created IBMid
* New Users may be asked to sign the IBM Quantum End User Agreement that is also located here

Please reach out to Dr. Nicolas Renaud for more information at: n.renaud@esciencecenter.nl
