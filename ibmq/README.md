# Accessing IBMQ platform

Members of QAL can request access to the QAL Hub by asking one of the QAL admins to add you as a collaborator on one of the projects. To access the IBMQ platform via the QAL Hub:

* First, create an [IBMid](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-19776&target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.ibm.com%2Foidc%2Fendpoint%2Fdefault%2Fauthorize%3FqsId%3Dd17ee2a1-5e9a-44f9-85de-0e5d27e0d6d3%26client_id%3DN2UwMWNkYmMtZjc3YS00) using your institution domain email address. It must be, for example, name@esciencecenter.nl. IBMid accounts using email domains such as gmail, Hotmail or other personal domains cannot be used to access the QAL Hub directly. 
* Sign up for [IBM Quantum Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) (IQX) account using your newly created IBMid
* New Users may be asked to sign the IBM Quantum End User Agreement that is also located here
